# Second session: Mapping Engineering

We discuss here some advanced topics related to mappings engineering and the exploitation of
available database constraints, which affect the performance of generated SQL queries:

1. [Role of primary keys](primary-keys.md)
2. [Role of foreign keys](foreign-keys.md)
3. [Choice of the IRI templates](uri-templates.md)
4. [Existential reasoning](existential.md)
