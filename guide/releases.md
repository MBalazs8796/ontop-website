# Release notes

## 4.1.0 (upcoming)

#### Changed behavior
 - OBDA to R2RML mapping conversion requires by default access to DB metadata (through credentials or as a serialized file). This requirement can be bypassed with the argument `--force`.
 - By default, DESCRIBE queries only return the triples where the described IRI appears as subject. To also consider the triples where it appears as object, set the parameter `ontop.includeFixedObjectPositionInDescribe` to true.
 - The Docker endpoint image is now based on Debian ([#394](https://github.com/ontop/ontop/issues/394)), not on Alpine anymore.

#### New features

- Support for GeoSPARQL added ([#335](https://github.com/ontop/ontop/issues/335)).
- [Rich JSON-based query logging](/guide/advanced/logging) added.
- New endpoint for predefined queries added (beta). It enables the specification of custom low-latency Web APIs in a declarative manner.
- Support for the `IF`, `IRI`, `BNODE` SPARQL functions added.
- Supported for Dremio and Teiid added.
- DB Metadata can now be loaded from files instead of connecting to the database.
- Bnode labels are now anonymized on-the-fly. Bnode templates can safely use PII.
- Sensitive JDBC information (user, password, url) can now be passed as arguments or environment variables (for Docker) instead of being written in the properties file. Docker secrets are also supported for further security.
- Basic support for Ontop views added (experimental). In particular, this allows to specify integrity constraints on views defined at the Ontop-level.
- New left join optimization techniques added. General functional dependencies are now taken into account. Sensitivity to left-join ordering minimized.
- [HTTP caching](/guide/advanced/caching) headers can now be returned by the Ontop SPARQL endpoint.

#### Removal
 - As announced before, the RDF4J Workbench-based bundles are not shipped anymore. However, the webapps war file can still be built with Maven.

#### Refactoring

- Drastic reduction of memory consumption when processing SPARQL queries ([#370](https://github.com/ontop/ontop/pull/370)). Significative when materializing large RDF graphs.
- Better file resource handling ([#368](https://github.com/ontop/ontop/pull/368)).
- Distinct lifting improved.
- Self-join elimination based on functional dependencies re-implemented.
- Decomposition of heterogeneous IRI templates enabled.
- Lexical value space is now considered when decomposing IRIs. 
- Protégé plugin codebase cleaned.
- RDF4J external binding management refactored.
- Bnode handling refactored.
- Java 11 support.
- Better handling of column names when converting OBDA mappings into R2RML. It now uses DB metadata.
- Parser for OBDA mappings refactored.
- CONSTRUCT and DESCRIBE query handling refactored.
- Character encoding in R2RML templates refactored.
- Default file encoding set to UTF-8. Particularly useful on Windows. Can be overridden if needed.
- Build script refactored. Now fully based on Maven ([#393](https://github.com/ontop/ontop/pull/393)) *(to be merged)*.
- Base Docker image updated.
- PostgreSQL transaction handling (in streaming mode) improved.
- Timeout support extended to non-SELECT queries.

Many bugfixes.


## 4.0.3 (October 16, 2020)

#### Bugfixes

- Wrong IRI decomposition ([#358](https://github.com/ontop/ontop/issues/358))
- Logback config file ignored by Ontop CLI ([#361](https://github.com/ontop/ontop/issues/361))

## 4.0.2 (September 3, 2020)

- Fixed Named Graphs (quad) grammar in the target of the Ontop native mapping language.

## 4.0.1 (August 28, 2020)

#### New features and bugfixes

- Named Graphs (quad) are supported in materialization ([#343](https://github.com/ontop/ontop/issues/343))
- Removal of Jena as a dependency ([#349](https://github.com/ontop/ontop/issues/349))
- `com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver` is now also recognized. Non-recognized drivers now use the default SQL factories instead of the mock-up one.


## 4.0.0 (July 31, 2020)

#### Refactoring
* Dependencies updated (e.g. RDF4J 3.3.0)
* SERIAL datatypes of PostgreSQL better handled
* Anonymous blank nodes are now supported in CONSTRUCT blocks
* JSON-LD now supported for graph queries
* Denodo support improved.

Few bugfixes.


## 4.0.0-rc-1 (July 8, 2020)

#### Changed behavior
 - Streaming mode is enabled by default for query answering. It fetches data by batches of 500 results. 

#### New features

- Support of GROUP_CONCAT added. All the standard SPARQL aggregation functions are now supported.
- Named graphs are now supported.
- Support of Denodo added. Support of Dremio is postponed to 4.1.
- Support XML catalog file added (beta). It enables resolving `owl:imports` assertions from the ontology by loading local files instead of fetching remote URLs. It is available in Protégé and with the `ontop endpoint` CLI command.
- DB metadata extraction CLI command added (experimental).
- CASE and CAST is now supported in the mapping.
- Streaming mode for query answering added.

#### Deprecation

- The RDF4J Workbench-based SPARQL endpint is deprecated. Tomcat, Jetty bundles and webapps (.war files) will be removed in a future version. Users are recommended to switch to the `ontop endpoint` CLI or its Docker image.

#### Removal
 - The Mapping Assistant panel has been removed from the Ontop Protégé plugin.

#### Refactoring

- SQL parsing of the mapping improved. JSQLParser's version has been updated.
- Metadata extraction refactored, and SQLDialectAdapter has been eliminated. 
- Meta-mapping management improved.
- Non-recognized SQL functions in the mapping are now only assumed to be deterministic. Other assumptions have been removed.
- Internal data nodes now create variables only for database columns that are used in the query. This sparse usage of variables strongly improve reformulation time and log readibility when using tables with 100+ columns in the mapping.

Many bugfixes.


## 4.0.0-beta-1 (December 23, 2019)

#### Changed behaviors

-   Cardinality is now enforced by default (duplicates are removed at
    the mapping level). This is required to support most of the
    aggregation functions.
-   Functions in the SQL queries of the mapping that are unknown to
    Ontop do no cause the creation of SQL views anymore. The strategy
    regarding SQL functions moved from white-list to black-list.
-   Types returned by supported SPARQL functions now strictly follow the
    SPARQL 1.1 specification.

#### New features

-   SPARQL Aggregation functions SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX are now
    supported. SAMPLE is currently implemented as MIN.
-   Joins over terms that are constructed using different functions are
    now supported.
-   Some functions (such as IRI templates) can now be post-processed
    (that is, they are not always included in the SQL query anymore).
    Generated SQL queries are generally less verbose than before.
-   The Ontop endpoint now has the portal option, where predefined
    queries are shown in the Web interface.
-   The NULLIF SQL function is now supported and optimized. Useful for
    filtering out some unwanted values in the mapping assertions.
-   OPTIONALs outside the well-designed fragment are now supported.
    Weakly well-designed queries encoding preferences are optimized.

#### Refactoring

-   The typing system have been entirely redesigned. RDF types and
    database types are now clearly separated. Each database engine can
    now bring in its own data types.
-   The Datalog data structure (from version 1.x) for representing
    queries internally has been removed.
-   Function symbol creation and optimization has been entirely
    refactored. They are constructed by two factories, the
    FunctionSymbolFactory and the DBFunctionSymbolFactory.
-   Most of the logic of SQLDialectAdapter has been moved to
    DBFunctionSymbolFactory and DBTypeFactory. Each database engine is
    expected to have its own implementation of these new interfaces.
-   The SPARQL translation has been rewritten (was formerly translating
    into Datalog).
-   The SQL generator has been rewritten (was formerly translating from
    Datalog).

#### Temporary limitation

-   Due to a complete refactoring of the SQL dialect management, only
    the H2, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL server and DB2 dialects are
    supported in this beta. Dremio and Denodo dialects are expected to
    be supported in a next beta release.

Many bugfixes.


## 3.0.1 (December 9, 2019)

#### Changed behaviors

-   Protégé: no property file (resp. mapping file) is created if no data
    source (resp. mapping assertion) is specified by the user.

#### New features

-   Ontop endpoint now supports R2RML files and doesn\'t require an
    ontology.
-   Materialization: N-triples format is now supported.

#### Refactoring

-   Rewriting of the tree-witness rewriter (now independent from
    Datalog)

#### Bug fixes

-   Protégé: fixed issues related to prefix management.
-   Reasoning: issue related to the handling of inverse properties
    fixed.

## 3.0.0 (August 23, 2019)

#### Changed behaviors

-   The \`rdfs:range\` of a data property is not used anymore for
    inferring the non-specified datatype in a mapping assertion but for
    validating the datatype once specified or inferred. Datatype
    inference is now based on the DB datatype and follows the R2RML
    natural mapping (https://www.w3.org/TR/r2rml/\#natural-mapping)

#### New features

-   Support of Protege 5.5
-   Support of BNode in R2RML
-   Basic support for the \`geo:wktLiteral\` datatype (\#256)
-   New command-line interface for SPARQL endpoint
-   Docker container for SPARQL endpoint
    (https://hub.docker.com/r/ontop/ontop-endpoint)
-   Preliminary support of Dremio
-   Preliminary support of Denodo
-   The ordering of SPARQL variables is now preserved (\#291)
-   N-Triples output for materialization added
-   The SQL translation now appears as a sub-tab in the Protégé Ontop
    SPARQL tab

#### Refactoring

-   The triple predicate is now systematically used in the mapping and
    during query unfolding
-   Atom predicates and function symbols are now clearly distinguished
-   The Datalog-based data structure is not used anymore at mapping
    processing time and by the default rewriter
-   Query containment-based optimizations applied to the mapping after
    saturation improved
-   The materializer is now based on RDF4J (instead of OWLAPI)

#### Project organisation

-   Release of Ontop on both SourceForge and GitHub (\#274)
-   A new repository for the tutorial
    (https://github.com/ontop/ontop-tutorial)

Many bugfixes.

## 3.0.0-beta-2 (February 28, 2018)

#### Changed Behaviours

-   The JDBC driver class name is now required in Protégé (issue \#248)

#### New features

-   Novel left join optimization techniques (issue \#230)
-   LIMIT appended to test SQL queries and SPARQL queries in Protégé
-   Report illegal usage of Fully qualified column names (FQDN) in the
    target part of a mapping assertion
-   Support for the SPARQL isNumeric function

#### Refactoring

-   Internal representation of the ontology improved
-   Improvement of the intermediate query representation (issues \#235,
    \#236)

-   More robust handling of IRI-safe encoding (issue \#245)

#### Bug Fixes
Many, see [closed issues](https://github.com/ontop/ontop/milestone/7?closed=1).

## 3.0.0-beta-1 (August 11, 2017)

Note that this is the first release from version 3 series with many
internal refactoring and improvements, and bug fixes. However, these
changes also cause incompatibility with Ontop v1. See [the migration
guide](MigrationGuideV1toV3 "wikilink").

#### Changed Behaviours

-   JDBC connection information is stored in a separate properties file
-   Fully qualified columns (table.column) are not allowed in the target
    part of the mapping language. One has to explicitly create an alias
    (e.g. table.column AS table\_column) and use the alias in the
    target. (complying with R2RML)
-   The rules for datatype type inference and checking are changed. Now
    we use only mapping and database to infer the datatypes (complying
    with R2RML), and the (range axioms) in the ontologies to check the
    compatibility (complying with OWL).

#### New features

-   Major refactoring of the internal structure of the Ontop system
-   Databases for Integration Tests have been dockerized.
-   Upgrade Sesame to the latest version of RDF4J (v2.2.2).

    property assertion from INT to BIGINT to be able to handle
    `xsd:integer` type
-   Set index creation during Quest startup
-   Implement new feature for bootstrapping, command line scripts,
    integration in ontoPro plugin
-   Updated the URI templates in Turtle mapping syntax to make it
    simpler and closer to Turtle. Now quotes, question marks and
    class/property declarations are no longer required

For example, in the previous syntax:

      <"test;person/{?id}"> a :MyClass; :hasName {?name}.

becomes simply

     test:person/{id} a :MyClass ; :hasName {name} .

-   Support \"%\", \"=\", \";\" characters in the URI template.

<!-- -->

      :class/{id};{name}%{class type}

-   Bug fix: Major bugs in execution handling SPARQL Construct and
    SPARQL Describe queries.
-   Bug fix: Issues related to commits and batch sizes in
    QuestOWLStatement
-   Bug fix: Issue with URI template matcher that generates `null` in
    case failed template (now it generates URI(\"xxxx\") where xxx is
    the URI that was being matched.)
-   Bug fix: Issue in existential clause in tree-witness algorithm
-   Bug fix: Issue in the maximum size of URI that has more than 400
    characters
-   Bug fix: Issue in some data that can not be tracked when inserted
    into the database. In particular if the data comes from
    classes/properties that were simplified by the equivalence
    resolution.
-   Bug fix: Issue in exception handling during index creation in
    semantic index test.
-   Bug fix: Issue in SQL parser that it doesn\'t capture the scope
    within parentheses in the WHERE clause.
-   Remove table and column identifier quotes in the SQL target query
    string so that the parser can parse properly. For example:

<!-- -->

      SELECT "Student"."sid" from "Student"

will become:

      SELECT Student.sid from Student

-   New semantic index implementation with integer references for URIs
    for faster query answering (faster joins on integers instead of
    strings)

**Ontop source code**

-   Ontop is now in GitHub!
-   Cleaner and slimmer project structure. We removed obsolete classes
    and tests.

    Tree-Witness rewriting, Data materialiser, SQL parser, SPARQL
    Construct, SPARQL Describe, SPARQL Optional, Database metadata and
    Query completeness.

## 1.7-alpha (rev 2039, December 30, 2012)

**SPARQL support**

-   Support for most SPARQL built in functions, e.g., arithmetics, type
    checking, etc.
-   Support for CONSTRUCT and DESCRIBE result forms
-   Support for OPTIONAL and bound, which allow you to have NEGATION in
    the usual SPARQL 1.0 style.
-   Support for variables in ANY position, e.g., to allow queries such
    as SELECT ?p ?v WHERE { ?x :name \"John Smith\". ?x ?p ?v }
-   Stronger compliance to standard RDF and SPARQL semantics for FILTER
    expressions

**Performance**

-   Multiple improvements to the SPARQL-to-rule translation, mapping and
    TBox optimization algorithms.
-   New algorithm for query rewriting w.r.t. the TBox that increases the
    performance of query answering by many orders of magnitude when
    inference w.r.t. to existential constants is enabled. The
    implementation has been contributed by Dr. Roman Kontchakov.
-   New benchmarks. We tested against Virtuoso triple store, Virtuoso
    RDF views and D2R Server using the BSBM and FishMark benchmarks.

**APIs and Accessibility**

-   Completely new Sesame API provider, now users of Sesame can create
    \"Virtual RDF repositories\" with -ontop-
-   SPARQL end-point support through integration with Sesame\'s
    workbench

**Mapping language**

-   Improved support for default literal types, now it conforms with the
    R2RML \"Natural Mapping\" specification
-   Support for language tags obtained from the DB
-   Proper support for constants in the mappings
-   Proper internal handling of NULL values in the database (as
    recommended by the R2RML standard)
