# H2

Through the [H2](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) connector, Ontop is able to construct VKGs on H2 databases, in memory, and on files.


## Limitations & Exceptions

- SPARQL _hash_ functions are not supported for H2.
- Nested data types and the [flatten lens](/guide/advanced/lenses#flattenlens) are not supported for H2

## Database Connection

The following shows the content of a sample `.properties` file that can be used to connect Ontop to H2:

```bash
jdbc.url = jdbc:h2:mem:database-name
jdbc.user = user
jdbc.password = password
jdbc.driver = org.h2.Driver
```

## Nested Type Support

Nested data types and the [flatten lens](/guide/advanced/lenses#flattenlens) are not supported for H2.
