# Introduction

Ontop is a Virtual Knowledge Graph system. 
It exposes the content of arbitrary relational databases as knowledge graphs. These graphs are virtual, which means that data remains in the data sources instead of being moved to another database. 

Ontop translates [SPARQL queries](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) expressed over the knowledge graphs into SQL queries executed by the relational data sources. It relies on [R2RML mappings](https://www.w3.org/TR/r2rml/) and can take advantage of lightweight ontologies.

Versions
--------
This documentation is for Ontop 3.0 and more recent versions.

For earlier versions, please refer to [our previous Wiki](https://github.com/ontop/ontop/wiki).

Most recent version:
* Stable:  Ontop 4.0.3, released on October 16, 2020.

See [release notes](/guide/releases) for more details.


Main features
-------------

* Uses RDF 1.1 as graph data model
* Supports RDFS and OWL 2 QL ontologies
* Supports R2RML and Ontop mappings
* Supports the majority of SPARQL 1.1 features, including the main SPARQL aggregation functions (since 4.0-beta-1)
* Can be deployed as [a SPARQL endpoint](/guide/cli#ontop-endpoint)
* Produces efficient SQL queries by applying many optimizations
* Supports the main database systems (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL server, Oracle and DB2)
* Supports database federators such as Denodo (beta) and Dremio (upcoming with 4.1)
* Can [materialize](/guide/cli#ontop-materialize) virtual graphs into RDF files
* Provides a plugin for editing and testing mappings in the [Protégé ontology editor](https://protege.stanford.edu/)

Organizations
-------------
Ontop is backed by the [Free University of Bozen-Bolzano](https://www.inf.unibz.it/krdb/in2data/) and [Ontopic s.r.l.](https://ontopic.biz). It also receives regular important contributions from [Birkbeck, University of London](http://www.bbk.ac.uk/). See the [community section](/community) for more details.
